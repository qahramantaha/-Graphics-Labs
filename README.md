Lab 1 - In this exercise, we created shapes (square, triangle, circles and a pacman facing upwards) using polar to cartesian coordinate conversion with rgb & rgba colors and strokes using HTML canvas tags and the JavaScript canvas API.

Lab 2 - In this exercise I used requestAnimationFrame() to animate a ball movingaround the canvas.
        I stopped the ball moving when it hits the bottom of the canvas.
        I changed the code so that the ball starts moving up the way once it reaches the bottom of the screen.
        I changed the code so that the ball bounces from the bottom to the top of the screen, and back again repeatedly.
        I gave the ball a horizontal velocity, as well as a vertical one, and had it bounce off the left and right              sides of the canvas also.
        I represented the ball as a class/object (that includes attributes such as x & y position, x & y velocity,              radius etc. and methods such as draw, move, resize)
        Added to the ball class so that the ball now looks like the pacman facing upwards (using cartesian to polar             conversion).
